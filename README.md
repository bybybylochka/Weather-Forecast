# Weather forecast
This project is a mobile version of the weather forecast website. To obtain meteorological information, the Open-Meteo weather forecast API was used.
## Functions
In the developed web application, the main functions that are usually necessary for the user to obtain comprehensive information about the weather were implemented. When the site loads and permission is obtained, the user's location is determined, which is then displayed in the search bar (you can also enter the name of the desired city manually). Next, detailed information is displayed on the weather for today: temperature (current and hourly), chance of precipitation, wind speed, forecast visualization, and so on. You can also see the change in the maximum temperature during the week on the graph. The same detailed information is available for the following day. And there is a section "14 days" where you can view brief information about the forecast.
